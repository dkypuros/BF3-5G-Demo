Excellent question. The "latest" 3GPP specification isn't a single document but a collection of features and standards grouped into a **Release**.

As of mid-2025, the latest completed major specification is **Release 18**, which introduces the era of **5G-Advanced**. The next set, **Release 19**, is currently under active development.

Here’s a breakdown of what this means.

### Latest Completed: Release 18 (The Start of 5G-Advanced)

Release 18 is a significant milestone, marking the evolution from 5G to "5G-Advanced." It builds upon the 5G foundation to enhance performance and enable more sophisticated use cases.

* **Status:** **Functionally Frozen.** The core functionality and protocols (ASN.1) for Release 18 were frozen in June 2024. This means the features are stable, and manufacturers can confidently develop equipment based on them.
* **Key Focus Areas:**
    * **Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning (AI/ML):** Integrates AI/ML into the Radio Access Network (RAN) for smarter network management, including improved energy efficiency, load balancing, and mobility optimization.
    * **Extended Reality (XR):** Provides specific enhancements to support the demanding latency and throughput requirements of Augmented Reality (AR), Virtual Reality (VR), and cloud gaming.
    * **Enhanced Network Performance:** Includes improvements to Massive MIMO, beamforming, and mobility to increase data rates, improve coverage, and make handovers more seamless.
    * **Reduced Capability (RedCap) Evolution:** Further develops support for lower-cost, lower-power 5G devices for IoT use cases, such as wearables and industrial sensors.
    * **Non-Terrestrial Networks (NTN):** Improves support for satellite-based communications, enhancing coverage in remote areas.
    * **Sidelink Enhancements:** Boosts direct device-to-device communication, crucial for Vehicle-to-Everything (V2X) and public safety applications.

### Currently in Development: Release 19

Release 19 continues the 5G-Advanced track, further refining the features introduced in Release 18 and adding new capabilities that bridge the gap toward 6G.

* **Status:** **In Progress.** The scope and work items were defined in late 2023 and early 2024. The work is ongoing in various 3GPP technical groups.
* **Target Freeze Date:** The functional freeze is expected around late 2025 to early 2026.
* **Expected Focus Areas:**
    * **Ambient IoT:** Aims to enable ultra-low-power, simple devices that can potentially operate by harvesting energy from their environment, connecting billions of new sensors and trackers.
    * **Further AI/ML Integration:** Expands the use of AI/ML for network optimization, positioning, and beam management.
    * **Advanced XR and Metaverse Support:** Continues to improve network capabilities to support truly immersive experiences.
    * **Integrated Sensing and Communication (ISAC):** Explores using 5G signals for sensing applications, like radar, to detect objects, motion, and position, creating new possibilities for environmental awareness.

### How to Understand 3GPP Specifications

It's helpful to know how the specifications are organized:

* **Releases:** A release is a bundle of hundreds of individual specification documents that are developed and frozen on a shared timeline.
* **Specification Series:** Specifications are numbered. For example, the `TS 23.501` specification defines the "System architecture for the 5G System." When you see a specification, it's always tied to a specific Release.

You can find all official documents on the **3GPP specifications portal**.
